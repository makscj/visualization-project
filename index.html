                            <h3>List of Features</h3>
                            <h4>Acousticness</h4>
                            <p>A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence
                                the track is acoustic.</p>

                            <h4>Danceability</h4>
                            <p>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical
                                elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value
                                of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p>

                            <h4>Energy</h4>
                            <p>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
                                Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high
                                energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to
                                this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general
                                entropy.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Instrumentalness</h4>
                            <p>Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental
                                in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness
                                value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above
                                0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value
                                approaches 1.0.</p>

                            <h4>Liveness</h4>
                            <p>Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased
                                probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood
                                that the track is live.</p>

                            <h4>Speechiness</h4>
                            <p>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like
                                the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
                                Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values
                                between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections
                                or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music
                                and other non-speech-like tracks.</p>

                            <h4>Valence</h4>
                            <p>A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with
                                high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low
                                valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</p>

                            <h4>Popularity</h4>
                            <p>The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.</p>

                            <p>The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The
                                popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number
                                of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.</p>

                            <p>Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than
                                songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single
                                and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically
                                from track popularity. Note that the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few
                                days: the value is not updated in real time.</p>
